# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Small syntax details. Figuring out how to escape for single quotes, the difference between using : and => caused some issues and remembering how to use string interpolation.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note taking is going ok. I don't do it enough when I am doing my own experiments and research on topics I encounter. I have been doing a good job of taking notes on live and async lessons.
I have also been reviewing those notes and putting them in a digital format at the end of the day.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I almost always like to experiment on my own before googling a problem. I feel like it better prepares me to google the problem if I mess around a bit first.
